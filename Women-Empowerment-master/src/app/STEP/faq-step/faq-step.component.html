                                    <p>The Support to Training & Employment Programme for Women (STEP) was launched as a
                                        Central Sector Scheme in 1986-87. The programme of STEP aims to make a significant impact on
                                        women by upgrading skills for self and wage employment. The sequence of activities is envisaged as
                                        mobilizing women in viable groups, improving their skills, arranging for productive assets/ access to
                                        wage employment, creating backward and forward linkage, improving/arranging for support services,
                                        providing access to credit, awareness generation, gender sensitization, nutrition education,
                                        sensitization of project functionaries etc. Thus, STEP advocates an integrated package of inputs
                                        aiming at the self-reliance and empowerment of women by enhancing their productivity and enabling
                                        them to take up income generation activities. The ultimate endeavour of each project should be
                                        develop the group to thrive on a self- sustaining basis in the market place with the minimal
                                        Government support and intervention after the project period is over. </p>
