                                    <p>The principle of gender equality is enshrined in the Indian
                                        Constitution in its Preamble, Fundamental Rights,
                                        Fundamental Duties and Directive Principles. The Constitution
                                        not only grants equality to women, but also empowers the state
                                        to adopt measures of positive discrimination in favour of
                                        women. ‘Empowerment’ may be described as a process which
                                        helps people to assert their control over the factors which affect
                                        their lives. Empowerment of women means developing them
                                        as more aware individuals, who are politically active,
                                        economically productive and independent and are able to make
                                        intelligent discussion in matters that affect them. Present
                                        article discusses about various initiatives taken by Government
                                        of India for empowering women by analysing position of India
                                        in Gender Inequality Index and Global Gender Gap Index of
                                        United Nations. Article concludes with the note that due
                                        recognition must be given to women and society should come
                                        forward to ensure equal status for women in all spheres of
                                        life.

                                    <p>The broad mandate of Ministry is to have holistic development
                                        of Women and Children. As a nodal Ministry for the advancement 
                                        of women and children, the Ministry formulates plans, policies 
                                        and programmes; enacts/ amends legislation, guides and coordinates 
                                        the efforts of both governmental and non-governmental organisations 
                                        working in the field of Women and Child Development. Besides, playing
                                        its nodal role, the Ministry implements certain innovative programmes
                                        for women and children. These programmes cover welfare and support 
                                        services, training for employment and income generation, awareness 
                                        generation and gender sensitization. These programmes play a supplementary
                                        and complementary role to the other general developmental programmes 
                                        in the sectors of health, education, rural development etc. 
                                        All these efforts are directed to ensure that women are empowered
                                        both economically and socially and thus become equal partners in
                                        national development along with men. </p>
